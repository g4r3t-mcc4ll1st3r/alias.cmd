:: NAME
::    RefrEnv - Refresh the Environment for CMD
::
:: SYNOPSIS
::    call refrenv.bat
:: 
:: DESCRIPTION
::    By default with no arguments, this script will do a full 
::    refresh (refresh all non critical variables*, and refresh the PATH).
::
::    you can use the following variables to change the default behaviour:
::
::    RefrEnv_ResetPath=yes       Reset the actual PATH inside CMD, then refresh
::                                it with a new PATH. This will delete any PATH 
::                                added by the script who called RefrEnv. It is 
::                                equivalent to running a new CMD session.
::
::    RefrEnv_debug=yes           Debug what this script do. The folder containing
::                                the files used to set the variables will be
::                                open, then see _NewEnv.sh, this is the file
::                                which run inside your script to setup the new
::                                variables, you can also revise the intermediate
::                                .txt files.


:: you can also put this script in windows\systems32 or another place in your %PATH% then call it from an interactive console by writing refrenv

:: *critical variables: are variables which belong to cmd/windows and should not be refreshed normally like:
:: - windows vars:
:: ALLUSERSPROFILE APPDATA CommonProgramFiles CommonProgramFiles(x86) CommonProgramW6432 COMPUTERNAME ComSpec HOMEDRIVE HOMEPATH LOCALAPPDATA LOGONSERVER NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS OS PATHEXT PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE PROCESSOR_ARCHITEW6432 PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER PROCESSOR_LEVEL PROCESSOR_REVISION ProgramData ProgramFiles ProgramFiles(x86) ProgramW6432 PUBLIC SystemDrive SystemRoot TEMP TMP USERDOMAIN USERDOMAIN_ROAMINGPROFILE USERNAME USERPROFILE windir SESSIONNAME


:: ___INFO_____________________________________________________________
:: :: this script reload environment variables inside cmd every time you want environment changes to propagate, so you do not need to restart cmd after setting a new variable with setx or when installing new apps which add new variables ...etc


:: This is a better alternative to the chocolatey refreshenv for cmd, which solves a lot of problems like:

:: The Chocolatey refreshenv is so bad if the variable have some cmd meta-characters, see this test:
    :: add this to the path in HKCU\Environment: test & echo baaaaaaaaaad, and run the chocolatey refreshenv you will see that it prints baaaaaaaaaad which is very bad, and the new path is not added to your path variable.
    :: This script solve this and you can test it with any meta-character, even something so bad like:
    :: ; & % ' ( ) ~ + @ # $ { } [ ] , ` ! ^ | > < \ / " : ? * = . - _ & echo baaaad
    
:: refreshenv adds only system and user environment variables, but CMD adds volatile variables too (HKCU\Volatile Environment). This script will merge all the three and ::ove any duplicates.

:: refreshenv reset your PATH. This script append the new path to the old path of the parent script which called this script. It is better than overwriting the old path, otherwise it will delete any newly added path by the parent script.

:: This script solve this problem described in a comment by @Gene Mayevsky: refreshenv modifies env variables TEMP and TMP replacing them with values stored in HKCU\Environment. In my case I run the script to update env variables modified by Jenkins job on a slave that's running under SYSTEM account, so TEMP and TMP get substituted by %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp instead of C:\Windows\Temp. This breaks build because linker cannot open system profile's Temp folder.

:: ________
:: this script solve things like that too:
:: The confusing thing might be that there are a few places to start the cmd from. In my case I run cmd from windows explorer and the environment variables did not change while when starting cmd from the "run" (windows key + r) the environment variables were changed.

:: In my case I just had to kill the windows explorer process from the task manager and then restart it again from the task manager.
:: Once I did this I had access to the new environment variable from a cmd that was spawned from windows explorer.

:: my conclusion:
:: if I add a new variable with setx, i can access it in cmd only if i run cmd as admin, without admin right i have to restart explorer to see that new variable. but running this script inside my script (who sets the variable with setx) solve this problem and i do not have to restart explorer


:: ________
:: windows recreate the path using three places at less:
:: the User namespace:    HKCU\Environment
:: the System namespace:  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment
:: the Session namespace: HKCU\Volatile Environment
:: but the original chocolatey script did not add the volatile path. This script will merge all the three and ::ove any duplicates. this is what windows do by default too

:: there is this too which cmd seems to read when first running, but it contains only TEMP and TMP,so i will not use it
:: HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Environment


:: ___TESTING_____________________________________________________________
:: to test this script with ext::e cases do
    :: :: Set a bad variable
    :: add a var in reg HKCU\Environment as the following, and see that echo is not executed.  if you use refreshenv of chocolatey you will see that echo is executed which is so bad!
    :: so save this in reg:
    :: all 32 characters: & % ' ( ) ~ + @ # $ { } [ ] ; , ` ! ^ | > < \ / " : ? * = . - _ & echo baaaad
    :: and this:
    :: (^.*)(Form Product=")([^"]*") FormType="[^"]*" FormID="([0-9][0-9]*)".*$
    :: and use set to print those variables and see if they are saved without change ; refreshenv fail dramatically with those variables
    
    
:: invalid characters (illegal characters in file names) in Windows using NTFS
:: \ / : * ? "  < > |  and ^ in FAT

:: this is a hybrid script which call vbs from cmd directly
:: :: The only restriction is the batch code cannot contain - - > (without space between - - > of course)
:: :: The only restriction is the VBS code cannot contain </script>.
:: :: The only risk is the undocumented use of "%~f0?.wsf" as the script to load. Somehow the parser properly finds and loads the running .BAT script "%~f0", and the ?.wsf suffix mysteriously instructs CSCRIPT to interpret the script as WSF. Hopefully MicroSoft will never disable that "feature".
